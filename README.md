# Serverless Architecture on AWS Using Lambda and EC2
This project explores the implementation of serverless architecture on AWS leveraging AWS Lambda and EC2 for compute resources. The goal is to build scalable, cost-efficient, and event-driven applications without the need to manage servers directly.

AWS Lambda enables running backend code in response to events (like HTTP requests, file uploads, or database changes) without provisioning or managing servers. It's ideal for lightweight, stateless workloads, with automatic scaling and a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

EC2 provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud, suitable for running full applications or long-running tasks that might not fit within Lambda's execution limits.

The combination of Lambda for event-driven, short-lived tasks and EC2 for more traditional, long-running services enables building flexible architectures that can handle both dynamic workloads and persistent services effectively.

This serverless architecture provides significant advantages, such as reduced operational overhead, improved scalability, and optimized cost management for web applications and microservices.
